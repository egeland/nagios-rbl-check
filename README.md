# Nagios RBL / DNSBL Check

A Python-based Nagios/Icinga plugin to check whether a host is listed on any known 
DNS-based spam blacklists.

# Requirements

The plugin requires Python version 2.6 or higher. If you are using a system with 
more than one version of Python installed, edit the first line of the `check_rbl.py` 
script to point to the locally-installed version of Python you wish to use. On RHEL 
systems, for example, this might look like:

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env python26
```

The Python library for IPv4/IPv6 manipulation is required (included in Python 3.3 
and later). You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install ipaddress
```

Or download it using a package manager, it's usually referred as `python-ipaddress`

# Usage

You can run the plugin using either a **hostname** (which will be resolved to an 
IP address) or an **IP address**:

```bash
./check_rbl.py -w <WARN level> -c <CRIT level> -h <hostname>
./check_rbl.py -w <WARN level> -c <CRIT level> -a <ipv4 address>
./check_rbl.py -w <WARN level> -c <CRIT level> -a <ipv6 address>
```

For example, to test whether hostname `mail.google.com` is listed on any known blacklist, 
with a **Warning** level of 1 blacklist and a **Critical** level of 3 blacklists, do:

```bash
./check_rbl.py -w 1 -c 3 -h mail.google.com
```

To test the plugin, check `127.0.0.2` or `::FFFF:7F00:2` which should always come 
back as "listed" on every known blacklist. For example:

```bash
./check_rbl.py -w 1 -c 3 -a 127.0.0.2
./check_rbl.py -w 1 -c 3 -a ::FFFF:7F00:2
```

# Known Blacklists

A list of known blacklists included in the `check_rbl.py` script is located on 
this Wiki page:

If you know of other DNS-based blacklists that should be considered for inclusion, 
please open an "Enhancement" issue.
